# TrashTracker.com
MERN stack application centered around a premise of making conservation a competition amongst friends, or just between a single person.


The purpose of this project is to make a platform where conservation can be made into a competition amongst friends!!

#How it works:

A user starts an account by making a username and password.
The user Goes to the "Create Challenge" page and inputs their most recent conservationist efforts. Conservation efforts can be done in water, paper, Emmisions and plastic.
The app stores user accounts and accumulated conservationalist efforts and displays them in graphs and fun terms on the User's "main Account" page. 
Just an FYI it takes a lot of plastic to save one fish!!
