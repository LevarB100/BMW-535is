# TrashTracker.com
MERN stack application centered around a premise of making conservation a competition amongst friends, or just between a single person.


The purpose of this project is to make a platform where conservation can be made into a competition amongst friends!!

#How it works:

A user starts an account by making a username and password.
The user then Goes to the "Create Challenge" page and inputs their most recent conservationalist efforts. Conservation efforts can be done in water, paper, Emmisions and plastic.
The app stores user accounts and accumulated conservational efforts and displays them in graphs and fun terms on the User's "main Account" page. Users can make accounts to track the progress and compare with friends. 
Just an FYI, it takes a lot of plastic to save one fish!! Also, you will be surprised how much water and oil is conserved when recycling paper!!

#Next Stages:

This application was made just to show my abilities as a FullStack Developer using the MERN stack framework. Inprovements needed for this app include to make it accessible to multi user accounts. Theat when groups can make group accounts that will track all the members of the groups progress and be accessible by all the group members for review. I would also like to expand it's tracking capabilities to different types of recyclable materials and conservation. For now its just having some fun with MERN stack. I hope you like it!
